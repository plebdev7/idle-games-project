# Authority Rule

【PLAN】 **STOP. Before doing ANYTHING: Use `todo_write` tool and present plan for approval.**

**Never implement on first reply. Ever.**

## Required Planning Process:
1. Use `todo_write` tool with `fetch_rule` calls interspersed throughout todos (mandatory for rule context refresh)
2. Present implementation plan
3. Wait for explicit user approval
4. Only then implement

## Action Tags
- 【STOP】 【CHOICE】 【VALIDATE】 【PLAN】

**Without `todo_write` during planning that includes `fetch_rule` calls interspersed as todo items, rules lose effectiveness and violations occur.**
