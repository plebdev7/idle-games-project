# Authority Rule

【PLAN】 **STOP. Before doing ANYTHING: Use `todo_write` tool and present plan for approval.**

**Never implement on first reply. Ever.**

## Required Planning Process:
1. **Call `get_timestamp()` to document planning session start time**
2. Use `todo_write` tool with `fetch_rule` calls interspersed throughout todos (repeated every few todos)
3. Present implementation plan with timestamp
4. Wait for explicit user approval
5. Only then implement

## Action Tags
- 【STOP】 【CHOICE】 【VALIDATE】 【PLAN】

**Without `todo_write` during planning that includes `fetch_rule` calls interspersed as todo items, rules lose effectiveness and violations occur.**
